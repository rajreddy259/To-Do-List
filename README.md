# CheckMark: A Fully Interactive To-Do List

Welcome to **CheckMark**, a fully interactive to-do list application created by Raj Reddy! This simple yet effective web application helps you keep track of your tasks with ease and style. The design focuses on user-friendliness, allowing users to add, manage, and remove tasks efficiently.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can easily add tasks to their to-do list using a simple input bar and button.
- **Task Management**: Each task can be marked as completed or deleted, allowing users to manage their to-do list effectively.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be accessible and user-friendly on various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Stylish Interface**: CheckMark features a modern and clean design with a beautiful background and smooth user interface, thanks to the Poppins font and CSS styling.

## How It Works

1. **Adding Tasks**: 
   - Enter your task into the input field that says "Please Add Task Here."
   - Click on the "Add Task" button to add it to your list.

2. **Managing Tasks**:
   - Each task appears in a list format with a checkbox next to it. 
   - You can mark a task as completed by checking the box, or remove the task by clicking the delete button on the right.

3. **Visuals and Design**:
   - The app utilizes a visually appealing background image and is styled with CSS to ensure a seamless user experience.
   - The container holding the tasks is centered on the page, with a white background, rounded corners, and a shadow effect for a clean and modern look.

## Files

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that structures the webpage. It includes the title, links to external fonts, and links to the `style.css` and `index.js` files.
- `style.css`: This CSS file handles the visual styling of the application. It ensures that the to-do list is visually appealing, with proper alignment, fonts, colors, and layout.
- `index.js`: This JavaScript file contains the logic for adding tasks, managing the task list, and handling user interactions like task completion and deletion.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic interactions and task management.
- **Google Fonts**: Poppins and other fonts are used for a modern, clean look.
